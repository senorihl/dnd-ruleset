    "description": "Barbarians are warriors defined by their connection to the primal forces of the multiverse, which manifests as a Rage. Far more than a mere emotion, and not limited to anger or fury, a Barbarian’s Rage is an incarnation of a predator’s ferocity, a storm’s unrelenting assault, and the churning turmoil of the sea.\n\nSome Barbarians personify their Rage as a fierce spirit or revered forebear. Others see it as a connection to the pain and anguish of the world, as an impersonal tangle of wild magic, or as an expression of their own deepest self. For every Barbarian, their Rage is a power that fuels not just battle prowess but also uncanny reflexes and heightened senses.\n\nSome Barbarians are uncomfortable when hedged in by walls and crowds, preferring to live in regions of unspoiled natural vitality they cherish primal forces at work in farmlands. While others recognize the vitality and beauty of cities. Barbarians of all sorts embrace their own place in the multiverse, valuing keen instincts and raw physicality.\n\nEven without the power of their Rage, Barbarians are skilled in combat and the use of weapons. When they do call on their Rage, it gives them superhuman strength and resilience. It also heightens their senses and reflexes, making the Rage useful beyond combat.\n\nBarbarians often serve as protectors and leaders in their communities. They charge headlong into danger so those who are under their protection don’t have to. Their courage in the face of danger makes Barbarians perfectly suited for adventuring. ",
